# Facebook Automatic Birthday Wisher  ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)

This is a python script which takes **Email ID** and **password** as input from the user and posts a **"Happy Birthday"** message on your friend's timeline who have birthday on that day. 

It uses a python module named "Selenium" and "Chrome Webdriver_Manager". Make sure you have Selenium and Webdriver_Manager installed and run this file using terminal because getpass may not work on other GUIs.
